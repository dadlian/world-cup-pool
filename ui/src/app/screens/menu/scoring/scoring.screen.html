  <h1>Group Stage</h1>
  <p>
    The World Cup 2022 group stage runs from Sunday 20th November to
    Friday 2nd December. Teams are divided into 8 groups and there are
    a total of 48 matches. For each of these matches you must select the
    team you think will win (or select no winner if you predict a draw) and
    your projected score. Group stage scoring is as follows:
  </p>
  <h2>Scoring</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Correctly predict match winner (or a draw): 1 point</li>
    <li>Correctly predict match score:  1 point</li>
    <li>Correctly predict team's group finish:  2 points</li>
    <li>Total points available: 160</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Knockouts</h1>
  <p>
    The World Cup 2022 knockout stage runs from Saturday 3rd December to
    Sunday 18th December. The top two teams from each group are seeded into
    a single-elimination knockout bracket that starts with the Round of 16
    and culminates in the World Cup Final. Similar to the group stage, you
    will predict a winner and a score for each of the 16 knockout games, which
    will determine which teams you think will advance in the tournament.
    Knockout scoring is as follows:
  </p>
  <h2>Scoring</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Correctly predict match score (after a.e.t):  1 point</li>
    <li>Each correctly predicted quater-finalist:  2 points</li>
    <li>Each correctly predicted semi-finalist:  4 points</li>
    <li>Each correctly predicted finalist:  8 points</li>
    <li><strong>BONUS</strong> Correctly predict third place:  4 points</li>
    <li><strong>BONUS</strong> Correctly predict world cup winner:  12 points</li>
    <li>Total points available: 80</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Tiebreaker</h1>
  <p>
    In the unlikely event of a tie, a tie-breaker prediction will be used to
    determine the winner. The tie-breaker prediction is the total attendance
    of all 64 world cup matches. For reference Russia 2018 had a total attendance
    figure of	3,031,768 (47,371 per match).
